# LoremSwiftum

**LoremSwiftum** is a lightweight lorem ipsum generator for iOS written in Swift. It supports generating texts in different formats (words, sentences, paragraphs), miscellaneous data (names, URLs, dates etc.) and placeholder images for iOS (`UIImage`). This is a reimplementation of the project [LoremIpsum](https://github.com/lukaskubanek/LoremIpsum) written in Objective-C.

## Installation

Since the package manager [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) doesn't support distribution of libraries written in Swift yet, the is easiest way to use this library is by integrating it as a framework. The framework can be built in the Xcode project contained in this repository.

## Usage

For the overview of the API provided by this library see the playground file `Examples.playground`.
